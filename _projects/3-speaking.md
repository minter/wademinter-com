## A captivating and engaging speaker

I enjoy getting out in front of people and talking about my passions: Great software, diverse development teams, supporting entry-level developers, and having a customer-focused mindset. I also emcee events - providing an entertaining and energetic experience for conference-goers.

> I had the absolute pleasure of working with Wade during the Innovate Raleigh Summit. Wade has been an incredible supporter of our regionâ€™s entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem and we are so grateful for his leadership. He is consistently kind, creative, generous, and not to mention hilarious -- a true joy to work with. I sincerely hope that we have the opportunity to work together again. --Bridget Harrington, Executive Director of Innovate Raleigh

One of my most popular workshops is my applied improv training. In only a few hours, I can take a group of introverted strangers and teach them about collaboration, listening, ideation, empathy, and more!

Here's a sampling of where I've spoken. I'd love to add your event to the list!

## RTP180

Since February 2018, I have been the host of [RTP180](https://frontier.rtp.org/rtp-180/), a monthly talk series at The Frontier in Research Triangle Park, presented by RTI International.

At RTP180, I keep the show fun and engaging, make the speakers look great, and facilitate Q&A with the audience.

Between March 2020 - July 2021, with the COVID pandemic, I worked with The Frontier to innovate an online version of RTP180, acting as a virtual host for the panel, and adapting to the needs of a Zoom-based format to keep the show engaging and educational.
