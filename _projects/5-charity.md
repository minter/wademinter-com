## Calls For Charity

In order to support the amazing work being done in our community by the [Carolina Hurricanes Foundation](https://www.nhl.com/hurricanes/community/foundation/), I am bookable on Cameo for customized announcements. Whether you're looking to have your name in a Carolina Hurricanes GOOOOOOOOOOOAAALLLLL, send your friends to the penalty box, announce a wedding or new baby, or basically anything else that would sound good in a loud voice, we can make that happen.

There are two ways to get a customized announcement:

1. Head over to [my page on Cameo](https://www.cameo.com/minter) and book a session. Be sure to give me as much detail as you can, so that I can make it special (favorite number, favorite players, fun facts, etc). Or...

2. Make a donation of at least $25 [directly to the Carolina Hurricanes Foundation](https://carolinahurricanesfoundation.org/forms/donate), and email me the receipt (to wade at wademinter dot com), along with the details of what you want in the call.

100% of proceeds go directly to the Carolina Hurricanes Foundation. So you can get a unique memory, and know that you're helping your community at the same time!
