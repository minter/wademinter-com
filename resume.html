<h2 id="my-career">My Career</h2>

<p>I am an accomplished, product-focused technology leader with 25+ years of experience building and managing high-performing, collaborative engineering teams in rapidly growing tech organizations. I’ve demonstrated success in diverse environments, from early stage startups to large corporations, with deep expertise in software development, devops and infrastructure management, along with an extensive subject matter background in sports technology, EdTech, and other mission-focused tech sectors. I have developed an excellent reputation as a mentor and developer of talent, cross-functional collaborator, and articulate technical leader who not only understands what makes customers happy, but knows how to successfully deliver.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am likely the only technology executive you know who is also a National Hockey League Public Address Announcer, improv comedian, pro wrestling ring announcer, and ice hockey player/goalie.</p>
